# Rcon

[![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/AgentME/MinecraftRcon.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/AgentME/MinecraftRcon)

This is a [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/) plugin for Minecraft servers
that allows console commands to be received over HTTP.

This is an alternative to Minecraft's native rcon functionality, which has
unresolved issues such as the following:
* https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-72390
* https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-87863

This plugin does not do any authentication by default. This plugin is intended
to listen on localhost or another restricted address for use by scripts
running on the same server. By default, the plugin listens to port 25576 on
localhost. (This is configurable in the plugin's `config.yml`.)

This plugin does not implement the native rcon protocol. It expects a client
to make a POST request to the path "/command", and to include a POST body
parameter named "command" containing the Minecraft console command to run.
When the Rcon plugin receives a POST request, the special header
"X-Anti-CSRF: 1" must be included. (This is a protection against CSRF attacks:
if you run this plugin on your computer set to only listen localhost, and you
browse the internet on your computer, then a website you visit can tell your
browser to make a POST request to any address including to the Rcon plugin,
but the website can't tell your browser to include arbitrary headers, so the
website won't be able to trigger Rcon commands.)

After the command is executed, all of the server's logs for a game tick are
mirrored to the response so that the client gets the output from the command.
Other output from the logs may be captured in this too.

Commands can be sent by using curl in a terminal like this:

    $ curl http://localhost:25576/command -H 'X-Anti-CSRF: 1' --data-urlencode 'command=list'

Tip: You should add the `--fail` flag to make curl exit with a nonzero exit
code on unsuccessful server responses if you're using curl from a script.

The Rcon plugin also responds to GET requests to the following paths:

* /info: This returns a JSON object containing information about the server.

```json
{
  "name": "Unknown Server",
  "version": "git-Spigot-642f6d2-fbe3046 (MC: 1.12.2)",
  "motd": "A Minecraft Server",
  "currentPlayerCount": 1,
  "maxPlayerCount": 20,
  "players": [
    {
      "name": "DaringMacil"
    }
  ]
}
```

* /healthcheck: This endpoint responds with a 200 status if the Rcon plugin
is working.

## Installing

Download the latest Rcon jar file from the
[project's Releases page](https://github.com/AgentME/MinecraftRcon/releases).
Place the jar file in the plugins/ directory. After the first run, the file
plugins/Rcon/config.yml file will be generated with default values.

## Configuration

In the plugins/Rcon directory, the config.yml file can be customized to set
the port and address that Rcon listens on. The default "localhost" address
means that Rcon will only be accessible from the computer running the Rcon
plugin. If the address value is set to "all", then it's important to configure
Rcon to require authorization or to configure the system's firewall to
restrict access to the port.

You can set Rcon to require a user name and password over HTTP Basic
authentication by creating a file "htpasswd" in the plugins/Rcon directory.
The file must be a text file that on each line contains a username, a colon,
and a bcrypt hash. This file may be generated by the htpasswd utility
(included in apache2-utils) as follows:

```
$ htpasswd -Bc htpasswd myusername
New password: 
Re-type new password: 
Adding password for user myusername
```

When the htpasswd file is present, Rcon will block any requests that are not
authenticated as a user in the file. When using curl, you can supply the
username and password by using the `--user` flag.

This plugin records some usage metrics to
https://bstats.org/plugin/bukkit/Rcon. You can opt out of this by
placing `enabled: false` in `plugins/bStats/config.yml`.
